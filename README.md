# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling. The example shows a route that fetches a user by ID but lacks proper handling for invalid IDs and non-existent users. This can lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes in production.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file demonstrates a route handler that retrieves a user by ID. However, it does not handle cases where the ID is invalid (not a number) or where the user does not exist. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version of the route handler. This version includes error handling for both invalid IDs and non-existent users, improving the robustness and reliability of the application.
